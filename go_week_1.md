### Connected Group
It's a group of stones with the same colour, such that every member of the group is connected to another member in the group horizontally or vertically. A group with only one stone is a singleton group.

### Arity
The arity of a stone (chess) means the maximum number of empty positions adjacent to the *connected group* ,to which the stone belongs, horizontally or vertically.

### Capture
When a *connected group*'s *arity* is 0, it will be removed from the board. In Go, removing means a connected group is captured.
You cannot play a stone so that its *connected group* will be captured. In short, you cannot kill yourself. You are allowed to caputure your oppoent's connected group by placing a stone on the chess board.
